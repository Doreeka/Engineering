            <b>1/19/2024</b> - This week we went over chemical engineering. Chemical engineering is the branch of engineering that deals with chemical production and the manufacture of products through chemical processes. A day or two after learning about chemical engineering, we made oobleck. Oobleck is a non-utonium liquid, meaning that it is solid when force is applied, and liquid when it is still. We made it by putting corn starch in a bowl then slowly adding water and mixing until it became the consistency we desired. I had lots of fun making and playing with oobleck, and I would recomend it to anyone.

            <b>1/26/2024</b> - This week we started a new project that we will be working on for the entire quarter. Each student got to choose if they wanted to build a mouse trap car or an arduino car. The goal is to have the car go as far as possible with the mouse trap car, and have the best maneuverability with the arduino car. I chose the mousetrap car, since I didn't feel confident with wiring and programming the arduino car. This week, my partner and I have only began to work on the cad. I think our design is pretty good, becuase the mouse trap car requires a long rod to go long distances, and we have that. Next week, I am planning on revising and completing the cad, then hopefully try to build the actual car. We have made two versions, so hopefully we'll get to build and test both of them, and see which one does better.

            <b>2/5/2024</b> - Last week I fully completed my cad. I also began to build the actual car. This week I am planning on fully finishing my car build and testing to see how it does. I will note how well it does and try different methods of setting it off, to see which one has the best outcome. This weekend was very similar to my other ones, which consists of sleeping in and playing video games.
