            <b>8/25/23</b> -  This week in Engineering class, we went over two slideshows. One was about saftey and the other was about the engineering process. On thursday, we did a really fun challenge with marbles and pvc pipes. The class was split into two teams and we had to get a marble into a cup using the pvc pipes. I learned that teamwork is the most important thing when working as a group. After someone was done with their pipe, they had to run over and give it to the next person. In my opinion, the activity we did was the most enjoyable thing of this class so far.

            <b>9/1/23</b> - This week we went over the basics of mechanical engineering. We learned what mechanical engineering entails and about simple machines. We began creating a ruth goldberg challenge on paper in which we had to use three simple machines to pop a balloon with a pin. On challenge day, we did a challenge on tinkercad. One judge was picked from each row and everyone made a home applience. I made a toaster as shown below, and I didnt win. I made the toaster using basic shapes such as cylinders and cubes.

            <b>9/9/23</b> - This week in engineering was very fun. I learned how to use tinkercad (the basics) and started making a rube goldberg machine. We began constructing our rube goldberg machine in tinkercad. I shared the cad with my group and we got to designing. We started with making a lever which launches a ball with the force of a baseball. The ball then goes to an inclined plaine, sliding into a cylinder. The cylinder rolls onto another inclined plaine then collides with dominos. The dominoes then fall into a pulley which rises another ball into yet another inclined plaine.Finally, the ball rolls into a needle which pops the balloon. The machines that we will be using are inclined plains, a lever, and a pulley. I think the most challenging part of this project will be the ending. I think that making the needle hit the balloon will be a difficult task since we can't hold the needle completely still.

            <b>9/15/23</b> - This week, we completely finished our rube goldberg machine. The hardest part of it was making the begining and end consistent. The begining was hard because we had to find the sweet spot to drop the ball every time. The ending was the hardest part, though. The cup kept on messing up no matter what we did. That was until Mr. Poole gave us a brilliant idea to tie two strings to the cup instead of one. This gave the cup stability while going up which kept it straight enough to pop the balloon at the end. We could have made it better by making it more consistent. This could be done by making the cuts straighter  This video is our final result which took many, many tries.

            <b>9/22/23</b> - This week, we competed with everyones rube goldberg machine. Ours went well and I think that it was a very fun experience to work with other people to build this. We also did two challenges this week. In one of them, we had to make a floataion device made purely out of a piece to hold the most weight for 5 minutes. Me and my partner won by using a simple rectangle design with walls, and learned that surface area is very important when trying to hold weight on something. The second challenge was about measurements. We had to use persice measurements to draw a letter E. After it was drawn, it got traded among other students and they had to recreate it. The person who had my paper recreated it perfectly. We learned that measurements are extremely important when building something. Finally, we went over computer engineering. Computer engineering is a combination of both computer science and electrical engineering. It interests me becuase I like to code and work with computers. I am most exited to take apart a computer and re-assenble it.

            <b>9/28/23</b> - This week, we learned the different parts of computers. We took apart and reassembled a desktop pc. We started with taking apart the side and front panel. After that, we unplugged a few cables then removed the hard drive and power supply. The ram came next which was simply removed by unclipping two pins then gently pulling it out. After the ram, we unscrewed the cpu cooler then took the cpu out. The last cbles were taken out after that and the screws came after. The motherboard was gently lifted out of the case and we were done. All of the steps were retraced to reassemble the computer. The computer aspect of computer engineering interest me such as taking apart and assembling computers. I learned that computers are made out of many parts that must work together in order to work. This weekend I will probably just sleep in and play video games like always.

            <b> 10/6/23</b> - This week we went over bioengineering slides. We learned that bioengineering is the application of biology and the tools of engineering to create useable, tangible, and econmically-viable products. The medical uses for bioengineering include prosthetics such as arms, legs, and even hearts that can work for 30 minutes. We also learned about biomimicry. Biomimicry is the study of mimicking biology and living orgnaisms to benefit our devices. For example, gekkos have velcro like feet that allow them to stick onto surfaces with ease. We can mimic this and use it for mars rovers. We also learned about the mantis shrimp which has the fastest and hardest punch. It even creates a flash of light when it hits something. After we went over bioengineering, we had to build a prosthetic hand with cardboard, rubber bands, string, and tape. My partner and I started with an idea which had 3 fingers and 3 rings. We stuck a finger in each ring and the prosthetic moved with it. After we realized that that wouldnt grip onto anytihng, we switched the design. We switched by removing the rings off of the hand and putting rope on each finger. I tied all of the ropes together and with a simple pull, all of the fingers would move. This design worked way better than the previous one and was able to pick up an empty water bottle. If I could do something different, If I had more time and was able to improve the hand, I would add more fingers just to get an overall better grip around the bottle. This weekend I will not be going to homecoming. I will probably just stay home since I've had a very long week full of tests and homework.

            <b> 10/13/23</b> - This week we learned about aerospace engineering. Aerospace engineering is a branch of engineering that involves design, manufacturing, and science of aircraft spacecraft. It involes strucutral design, navigation and control, guidence, and instrumentation. The two branches are aeronautical engineering and astronautical engineering. Aeronautical engineering involves crafts that stay in earths atmosphere. Astronautical engineering involves crafts that operate in outer space. The four forces on a flying object are weight, thrust, lift, and drag. Weight lowers it, thrust brings it forward, lift rises it, and drag brings it back. This week we also looked at quiz analytics. We learned that the scores were very bad and that we need to study more and try harder. Also, we started the cad for our new 2 liter bottle rocket project. It will be a rocket with water as fuel with air pressure pushing it out, making it move. Something that I like about this class is Mr. Poole's teaching style. I like how he goes over the slides of a new topic, gives us a worksheet about it, then he quizzes us on it. Also, we do a project about the engineering behind it.
