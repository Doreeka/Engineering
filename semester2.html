            <b>1/19/2023</b> - This week we went over chemical engineering. Chemical engineering is the branch of engineering that deals with chemical production and the manufacture of products through chemical processes. A day or two after learning about chemical engineering, we made oobleck. Oobleck is a non-utonium liquid, meaning that it is solid when force is applied, and liquid when it is still. We made it by putting corn starch in a bowl then slowly adding water and mixing until it became the consistency we desired. I had lots of fun making and playing with oobleck, and I would recomend it to anyone.
