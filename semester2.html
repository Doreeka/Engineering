            <b>1/19/2024</b> - This week we went over chemical engineering. Chemical engineering is the branch of engineering that deals with chemical production and the manufacture of products through chemical processes. A day or two after learning about chemical engineering, we made oobleck. Oobleck is a non-utonium liquid, meaning that it is solid when force is applied, and liquid when it is still. We made it by putting corn starch in a bowl then slowly adding water and mixing until it became the consistency we desired. I had lots of fun making and playing with oobleck, and I would recomend it to anyone.

            <b>1/26/2024</b> - This week we started a new project that we will be working on for the entire quarter. Each student got to choose if they wanted to build a mouse trap car or an arduino car. The goal is to have the car go as far as possible with the mouse trap car, and have the best maneuverability with the arduino car. I chose the mousetrap car, since I didn't feel confident with wiring and programming the arduino car. This week, my partner and I have only began to work on the cad. I think our design is pretty good, becuase the mouse trap car requires a long rod to go long distances, and we have that. Next week, I am planning on revising and completing the cad, then hopefully try to build the actual car. We have made two versions, so hopefully we'll get to build and test both of them, and see which one does better.

            <b>2/5/2024</b> - Last week I fully completed my cad. I also began to build the actual car. This week my goal is to fully complete my car's building and testing to see how it does. I will note how well it does and try different methods of setting it off, to see which one has the best outcome. By Friday, I will hopefully have finished building the car and will be done testing it, so I can build the V2 next week. This weekend was very similar to my other ones, which consists of sleeping in and playing video games.

            <b>2/13/2024</b> - Last week we finished building and testing our first car. The wheels were built extremely bad and we need to make them satraighter for our V2. We also decided to make the rod and base a little bit longer for extra distance traveled. To compensate for this extra weight, we decided to change the base to two layers instead of four. Something to do better for this week is to make the wheels straighter, and to do this we will be using a carpenter square. Also, instead of glueing the rod onto the mouse trap, we will use zip ties.

            <b>2/26/2024</b> - This week we fullty completed, tested, and competed with our cars. Analysis - The first car that we made had a major falaw. It was mainly that the whees were very off centered and wiggled alot and couldnt drive straight. After we realized that this car wouldn't make it far on the challenge day, we started the second one. With the second car, I had to make sure that the wheels were straight since that was the main flaw with our first one. I had spend about one full class period JUST on the wheels. Everything else was able to be made relatively quickly and effectively. With the new wheels, the car worked better than ever. It went over 100 feet. Thats about 25 feet further than our first one. We won on the challenge day with our 2nd car.
            <ol type="1">
            <li>Our car worked much better than my partner and I thought it would. It had a simple cardboard base with a mouse trap on it. Connected to the mouse trap was a rod with a string. The string was attatched to the back axle, which was made up of a straw and skewers. When the mouse trap would go off. the rod would slowly get pulled and pull the rope with it. When the rope got pulled. the axle rotated and the car would start moving.</li>
            <li>The furthest distance of our first car was 76.5 feet, and the furthest distance of our second car was 104 feet.</li>
            <li>The main differences between our two cars were the wheel stability and the rod length. These two factors helped the car go farther beause without straight wheels, we would have to stop it and adjust it. With a longer rod, the car could pull farther. The second car performed better because it had straighter wheels and a longer rod.</li>
            <li>If we were to make a 3rd car, there is only one thing that I would change. I would make the rod longer to get more distance. The rod can extend how far the car travels. I know this becuase our 2nd car with a longer rod went farther than our 1st car with a shorter rod. I learned that the car can go farther with a longer rod.</li>

            <b>3/4/2024</b> - This week we started a new project. The project is an egg drop. The goal is to drop an egg without breaking it. Specifically, we are going to drop it from two and a half stories. This will be done in teams of three. My team and I have thought of a design that we think would keep the egg un-shattered. We will make a rectagular cardboard box and completely surround it with straws. We will also attach a trash bag or two to the top of it to slow it down when falling. Inside the box, we will put baloons at the top and bottom to cushion the egg which is in the middle. Next to the egg, there will also be cotton balls. I am scared of the trash bag ripping and the straws breaking. If the trash bag rips, then the box will fall extremely fast, and if the straws break, then the box will directly hit the ground. The point of the straws are to cushion the fall when it hits the ground. I think the weakest part of our design is the straws.

            <b>3/13/2024</b> - This week we finished building and tested out our egg drop devices. My group surrounded the egg in a lot of cotton and tape. We then surrounded the egg and cotton in a bag, thne tied it with some string. We repeated this process a few more times to surround it in a bunch of layers. After we had this ball, we put it into a cardboard rectangular box. The box had A LOT of straws poking out of it from every direction. It also had a balloon at the bottom to reduce the impact. The actual egg drop went extremely well. My teamate even flipped it, instead of dropping it. After it hit the ground, we took it out of the box and spend a good time unraveling it from the strings, bag, and cotton. The egg was perfectly fine. It didn't even have a single scratch. I had to cut the egg drop video into two because it was over Github's file size limit. Over spring break, I dont know what I will be doing. I might hang out with friends, play video games, sleep in, etc.

            <b>3/29/2024</b> - This week we started a new project. The goal is to build a "boat" that will travel across an 8cm x 500cm gutter. That is about 3 inches wide and 16.4 feet long. Our design is inspired by an air boat. An air boat looks just like a normal boat, however it has a lip at the front that rises up from the rest of the boat. An air boat is also propelled by a giant fan in the back. Just like an air boat, our design has a fan in the back and the front of it rises. I expect it to preform well, traveling the whole distance. Last week was also spring break. My favorite part about spring break was sleeping in and hanging out with my friends.
