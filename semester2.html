            <b>1/19/2023</b> - This week we went over chemical engineering. Chemical engineering is the branch of engineering that deals with chemical production and the manufacture of products through chemical processes. A day or two after learning about chemical engineering, we made oobleck. Oobleck is a non-utonium liquid, meaning that it is solid when force is applied, and liquid when it is still. We made it by putting corn starch in a bowl then slowly adding water and mixing until it became the consistency we desired. I had lots of fun making and playing with oobleck, and I would recomend it to anyone.

            <b>1/26/2023</b> - This week we started a new project that we will be working on until the quarter ends. Each student to choose if they wanted to build a mouse trap car or an arduino car. The goal is to have the car go as far as possible.I chose a mousetrap car. This week we have only built the cad. I think my design is pretty good, becuase the mouse trap car needs a big rod to go long distances, and mine has that. Next week, I am planning on completeing and revising the cad, then building the actual car.
