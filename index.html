            8/25/23 -  This week in Engineering class, we went over two slideshows. One was about saftey and the other was about the engineering process. On thursday, we did a really fun challenge with marbles and pvc pipes. The class was split into two teams and we had to get a marble into a cup using the pvc pipes. I learned that teamwork is the most important team when working as a group. After someone was done with their pipe, they had to run over and give it to the next person. In my opinion, the activity we did was the most enjoyable thing of this class so far.
