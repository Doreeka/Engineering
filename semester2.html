            <b>1/19/2024</b> - This week we went over chemical engineering. Chemical engineering is the branch of engineering that deals with chemical production and the manufacture of products through chemical processes. A day or two after learning about chemical engineering, we made oobleck. Oobleck is a non-utonium liquid, meaning that it is solid when force is applied, and liquid when it is still. We made it by putting corn starch in a bowl then slowly adding water and mixing until it became the consistency we desired. I had lots of fun making and playing with oobleck, and I would recomend it to anyone.

            <b>1/26/2024</b> - This week we started a new project that we will be working on for the entire quarter. Each student got to choose if they wanted to build a mouse trap car or an arduino car. The goal is to have the car go as far as possible with the mouse trap car, and have the best maneuverability with the arduino car. I chose the mousetrap car, since I didn't feel confident with wiring and programming the arduino car. This week, my partner and I have only began to work on the cad. I think our design is pretty good, becuase the mouse trap car requires a long rod to go long distances, and we have that. Next week, I am planning on revising and completing the cad, then hopefully try to build the actual car. We have made two versions, so hopefully we'll get to build and test both of them, and see which one does better.

            <b>2/5/2024</b> - Last week I fully completed my cad. I also began to build the actual car. This week my goal is to fully complete my car's building and testing to see how it does. I will note how well it does and try different methods of setting it off, to see which one has the best outcome. By Friday, I will hopefully have finished building the car and will be done testing it, so I can build the V2 next week. This weekend was very similar to my other ones, which consists of sleeping in and playing video games.

            <b>2/13/2024</b> - Last week we finished building and testing our first car. The wheels were built extremely bad and we need to make them satraighter for our V2. We also decided to make the rod and base a little bit longer for extra distance traveled. To compensate for this extra weight, we decided to change the base to two layers instead of four. Something to do better for this week is to make the wheels straighter, and to do this we will be using a carpenter square. Also, instead of glueing the rod onto the mouse trap, we will use zip ties.

            <b>2/26/2024</b> - This week we fullty completed, tested, and competed with our cars.
            <ol type="1">
            <li>Our car worked much better than my partner and I thought it would. It had a simple cardboard base with a mouse trap on it. Connected to the mouse trap was a rod with a string. The string was attatched to the back axle, which was made up of a straw and skewers. When the mouse trap would go off. the rod would slowly get pulled and pull the rope with it. When the rope got pulled. the axle rotated and the car would start moving.</li>
            <li>The furthest distance of our first car was 76.5 feet, and the furthest distance of our second car was 104 feet.</li>
            <li>The main differences between our two cars were the wheel stability and the rod length. These two factors helped the car go farther beause without straight wheels, we would have to stop it and adjust it. With a longer rod, the car could pull farther. The second car performed better because it had straighter wheels and a longer rod.</li>
            <li>If we were to make a 3rd car, there is only one thing that I would change. I would make the rod longer to get more distance. The rod can extend how far the car travels. I know this becuase our 2nd car with a longer rod went farther than our 1st car with a shorter rod. I learned that the car can go farther with a longer rod.</li>
