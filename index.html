            <b>8/25/23</b> -  This week in Engineering class, we went over two slideshows. One was about saftey and the other was about the engineering process. On thursday, we did a really fun challenge with marbles and pvc pipes. The class was split into two teams and we had to get a marble into a cup using the pvc pipes. I learned that teamwork is the most important thing when working as a group. After someone was done with their pipe, they had to run over and give it to the next person. In my opinion, the activity we did was the most enjoyable thing of this class so far.

            <b>9/1/23</b> - This week we went over the basics of mechanical engineering. We learned what mechanical engineering entails and about simple machines. We began creating a ruth goldberg challenge on paper in which we had to use three simple machines to pop a balloon with a pin. On challenge day, we did a challenge on tinkercad. One judge was picked from each row and everyone made a home applience. I made a toaster as shown below, and I didnt win. I made the toaster using basic shapes such as cylinders and cubes.

            <b>9/9/23</b> - This week in engineering was very fun. I learned how to use tinkercad (the basics) and started making a rube goldberg machine. We began constructing our rube goldberg machine in tinkercad. I shared the cad with my group and we got to designing. We started with making a lever which launches a ball with the force of a baseball. The ball then goes to an inclined plaine, sliding into a cylinder. The cylinder rolls onto another inclined plaine then collides with dominos. The dominoes then fall into a pulley which rises another ball into yet another inclined plaine.Finally, the ball rolls into a needle which pops the balloon. The machines that we will be using are inclined plains, a lever, and a pulley. I think the most challenging part of this project will be the ending. I think that making the needle hit the balloon will be a difficult task since we can't hold the needle completely still.

            <b>9/15/23</b> - This week, we completely finished our rube goldberg machine. The hardest part of it was making the begining and end consistent. The begining was hard because we had to find the sweet spot to drop the ball every time. The ending was the hardest part, though. The cup kept on messing up no matter what we did. That was until Mr. Poole gave us a brilliant idea to tie two strings to the cup instead of one. This gave the cup stability while going up which kept it straight enough to pop the balloon at the end. We could have made it better by making it more consistent. This could be done by making the cuts straighter  This video is our final result which took many many tries.

            <b>9/22/23</b> - This week, we competed with everyones rube goldberg machine. Ours went well and I think that it was a very fun experience to work with other people to build this. We also did two challenges this week. In one of them, we had to make a floataion device made purely out of a piece to hold the most weight for 5 minutes. Me and my partner won by using a simple rectangle design with walls, and learned that surface area is very important when trying to hold weight on something. The second challenge was about measurements. We had to use persice measurements to draw a letter E. After it was drawn, it got traded among other students and they had to recreate it. The person who had my paper recreated it perfectly. We learned that measurements are extremely important when building something. Finally, we went over computer engineering. Computer engineering is a combination of both computer science and electrical engineering. It interests me becuase I like to code and work with computers. I am most exited to take apart a computer and re-assenble it.
