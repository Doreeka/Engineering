            <b>1/19/2024</b> - This week we went over chemical engineering. Chemical engineering is the branch of engineering that deals with chemical production and the manufacture of products through chemical processes. A day or two after learning about chemical engineering, we made oobleck. Oobleck is a non-utonium liquid, meaning that it is solid when force is applied, and liquid when it is still. We made it by putting corn starch in a bowl then slowly adding water and mixing until it became the consistency we desired. I had lots of fun making and playing with oobleck, and I would recomend it to anyone.

            <b>1/26/2024</b> - This week we started a new project that we will be working on for the entire quarter. Each student got to choose if they wanted to build a mouse trap car or an arduino car. The goal is to have the car go as far as possible with the mouse trap car, and have the best maneuverability with the arduino car. I chose the mousetrap car, since I didn't feel confident with wiring and programming the arduino car. This week, my partner and I have only began to work on the cad. I think our design is pretty good, becuase the mouse trap car requires a long rod to go long distances, and we have that. Next week, I am planning on revising and completing the cad, then hopefully try to build the actual car. We have made two versions, so hopefully we'll get to build and test both of them, and see which one does better.

            <b>2/5/2024</b> - Last week I fully completed my cad. I also began to build the actual car. This week my goal is to fully complete my car's building and testing to see how it does. I will note how well it does and try different methods of setting it off, to see which one has the best outcome. By Friday, I will hopefully have finished building the car and will be done testing it, so I can build the V2 next week. This weekend was very similar to my other ones, which consists of sleeping in and playing video games.

            <b>2/13/2024</b> - Last week we finished building and testing our first car. The wheels were built extremely bad and we need to make them satraighter for our V2. We also decided to make the rod and base a little bit longer for extra distance traveled. To compensate for this extra weight, we decided to change the base to two layers instead of four. Something to do better for this week is to make the wheels straighter, and to do this we will be using a carpenter square. Also, instead of glueing the rod onto the mouse trap, we will use zip ties.

            <b>2/26/2024</b> - This week we fullty completed, tested, and competed with our cars. Analysis - The first car that we made had a major falaw. It was mainly that the whees were very off centered and wiggled alot and couldnt drive straight. After we realized that this car wouldn't make it far on the challenge day, we started the second one. With the second car, I had to make sure that the wheels were straight since that was the main flaw with our first one. I had spend about one full class period JUST on the wheels. Everything else was able to be made relatively quickly and effectively. With the new wheels, the car worked better than ever. It went over 100 feet. Thats about 25 feet further than our first one. We won on the challenge day with our 2nd car.
            <ol type="1">
            <li>Our car worked much better than my partner and I thought it would. It had a simple cardboard base with a mouse trap on it. Connected to the mouse trap was a rod with a string. The string was attatched to the back axle, which was made up of a straw and skewers. When the mouse trap would go off. the rod would slowly get pulled and pull the rope with it. When the rope got pulled. the axle rotated and the car would start moving.</li>
            <li>The furthest distance of our first car was 76.5 feet, and the furthest distance of our second car was 104 feet.</li>
            <li>The main differences between our two cars were the wheel stability and the rod length. These two factors helped the car go farther beause without straight wheels, we would have to stop it and adjust it. With a longer rod, the car could pull farther. The second car performed better because it had straighter wheels and a longer rod.</li>
            <li>If we were to make a 3rd car, there is only one thing that I would change. I would make the rod longer to get more distance. The rod can extend how far the car travels. I know this becuase our 2nd car with a longer rod went farther than our 1st car with a shorter rod. I learned that the car can go farther with a longer rod.</li>

            <b>3/4/2024</b> - This week we started a new project. The project is an egg drop. The goal is to drop an egg without breaking it. Specifically, we are going to drop it from two and a half stories. This will be done in teams of three. My team and I have thought of a design that we think would keep the egg un-shattered. We will make a rectagular cardboard box and completely surround it with straws. We will also attach a trash bag or two to the top of it to slow it down when falling. Inside the box, we will put baloons at the top and bottom to cushion the egg which is in the middle. Next to the egg, there will also be cotton balls. I am scared of the trash bag ripping and the straws breaking. If the trash bag rips, then the box will fall extremely fast, and if the straws break, then the box will directly hit the ground. The point of the straws are to cushion the fall when it hits the ground. I think the weakest part of our design is the straws.

            <b>3/13/2024</b> - This week we finished building and tested out our egg drop devices. My group surrounded the egg in a lot of cotton and tape. We then surrounded the egg and cotton in a bag, thne tied it with some string. We repeated this process a few more times to surround it in a bunch of layers. After we had this ball, we put it into a cardboard rectangular box. The box had A LOT of straws poking out of it from every direction. It also had a balloon at the bottom to reduce the impact. The actual egg drop went extremely well. My teamate even flipped it, instead of dropping it. After it hit the ground, we took it out of the box and spend a good time unraveling it from the strings, bag, and cotton. The egg was perfectly fine. It didn't even have a single scratch. I had to cut the egg drop video into two because it was over Github's file size limit. Over spring break, I dont know what I will be doing. I might hang out with friends, play video games, sleep in, etc.

            <b>3/29/2024</b> - This week we started a new project. The goal is to build a "boat" that will travel across an 8cm x 500cm gutter. That is about 3 inches wide and 16.4 feet long. Our design is inspired by an air boat. An air boat looks just like a normal boat, however it has a lip at the front that rises up from the rest of the boat. An air boat is also propelled by a giant fan in the back. Just like an air boat, our design has a fan in the back and the front of it rises. I expect it to preform well, traveling the whole distance. Last week was also spring break. My favorite part about spring break was sleeping in and hanging out with my friends. Over the next and last 10 weeks of school, I want to maintain good grades. I also want to be able to bench press my own weight in PE class.

            <b>4/5/2024</b> - Over the last two weeks, we started and worked on a new project. We need to build a boat to get across a 500cm gutter. This week we finished building and tesintg our gutter boats. My teamate and I made two boats in total. After we finished building our first boat, we decided to test it because even if it failed, we still had enough time to make a new and better one. The test was very important because it exposed a big flaw. The flaw that I am talking about is that the motor fan kept on hitting the edge of the gutter. This added friction and didn't let the boat get to its maximum speed. Eventually, the boat slowed down and the water started to seep in, which led to it sinking. To counter this, on our second boat, we made the fan higher up. We did this by layering two popsicle sticks onto another set of two. Additioanlly, for the second boat, we reinforced the edges with cardboard. Besides these two changes, the two boats look practically identical. With the second boat, we also used a lot less tape. After competing with the second boat, it preformed horribly. It only went about 30 centimeters. Although this may sound bad, no one in the class even made it all the way across the 500cm gutter. Our motor fan was placed way too high, which caused it to tip over as soon as it started moving. If we had more time, we could have figured out ways to make it less heavy and figure out a better spot for the motor fan to be. My favorite parts of this class are the teacher and the students in it. I also liked that we implemented engineering skills into the real world by making projects. Mr. Poole is an extremely nice teacher that is not very strict. The studemts are also very funny and fun to work with. On the other hand, there really isn't anything that I disliked about the class. Right now, I dont have any plans for the weekend, but I might hang out with my friends.

            <b>4/15/2025</b> We have began our FINAL project of the year! The goal is to make a boat that will go all the way across and back in the CV pool. We are ONLY allowed to use cardboard and one roll of duct tape. We can use an infinite amount of cardboard. Two people must sit in it and go all the way across and back. I am exited because my group decided that will be one of the two people that gets to sit in the boat. Last week, we also did a challenge. The goal was to make the longest "bridge" out of just 20 post it notes. My teamate and I thought decided that we could get the most distance by cutting each post it note into 4 pieces. This would basically quadruple the distance of just connecting them one at a time. My teamate and I got to ~15 feet. Each post it note is 3x3 inches. 3x3 inches multiplied by 20 post it notes would be 60 inches, or 5 feet. Since we cut it into fourths, that should equal 20. We get this by multiplying 5 feet by 4, since the post it notes were into fourths. The 5 less feet was probably just from human error. It could also have been shorter becuase it was hanging down in the middle, and wasn't a straight exact line. It had some slack. Becuase the end of the year is near, I am looking forward to keeping my grades up. Getting good grades is my number one priority. I also want to continue to make new friends and just have fun in general.

            <b>4/26/2024</b> Over the past two weeks, we have been working hard on the boat. We have mainly been focusing on the walls. We decided that it would be better if we did the walls, and then the base after. The main problem that we are facing is the lack of cardboard. The other classes are usig a lot of the cardboard. We have a limited supply. I forsee my boat facing the challenge of weighing a lot. We are going to have about 300 pounds of humans, and the boat iself is going to weigh approximately 40 pounds. That is about 340 pounds in total, and our boat is supposedly going to hold 480. For the next upcoming weeks, I am exited to finish up the boat. I am also really exited to be sitting in the boat. I am not sure of any stereotypes that have been placed on me. Even if there stereotypes that have been placed on me, I don't really care about them. I dont like letting mean things get to my head. This weekend, I also think that I am going to have a lot of fun. I am going to be celebrating my friend's birthday at Six Flags. I have never been there, so I hope that it will be fun!

            <b>5/6/2024</b> During the last week, we have made TONS of progress, and even a change. First of all, the progress that we have made is completely finishing the walls. We made 4 1ft tall walls. Two are 5 feet long and the other two are 6 feet long. They are each 5 layers of cardboard thick. After we finished the walls, we began the creation of the base. The base was originally supposed to be 5ftx6ft, but after laying it out, we realized that it was massive. This is the one thing that we changed. We kept the length of 6 feet, but changed the width from 5 feet to ~39 inches, or ~3.25 feet. Because of this change in the base size, the walls aren't going to match up. We are going to have to trim two walls so that they will fit properly. This week, we are going to completely focus on the base. Since the walls are fully done (besides trimming them), we don't need to work on them anymore. Right now, my main concern is finishing on time. Before we changed the dimensions of the base, I was EXTREMELY worried about not finishing on time. Ever since we changed it, I got a little more confident about finishing it on time since it is a little less work. In my opinion, I prefer apple juice over orange juice. This is simply due to the fact that apple juice is just more refreshing no matter the scenario. Additioanlly, there is pulp in 90% of orange juices, which makes them absolutely terrible. I think that apple juice is just all around a better drink.
