            <b>8/25/23</b> -  This week in Engineering class, we went over two slideshows. One was about saftey and the other was about the engineering process. On thursday, we did a really fun challenge with marbles and pvc pipes. The class was split into two teams and we had to get a marble into a cup using the pvc pipes. I learned that teamwork is the most important thing when working as a group. After someone was done with their pipe, they had to run over and give it to the next person. In my opinion, the activity we did was the most enjoyable thing of this class so far.

            <b>9/1/23</b> - This week we went over the basics of mechanical engineering. We learned what mechanical engineering entails and about simple machines. We began creating a ruth goldberg challenge on paper in which we had to use three simple machines to pop a balloon with a pin. On challenge day, we did a challenge on tinkercad. One judge was picked from each row and everyone made a home applience. I made a toaster as shown below, and I didnt win. I made the toaster using basic shapes such as cylinders and cubes.

            <b>9/9/23</b> - This week we began constructing our rube goldberg machine in tinkercad. I shared the cad with my group and we got to designing. We started with making a lever which then launches a ball with the force of a baseball. The ball then goes to an inclined plaine sliding into a cylinder. The cylinder rolls onto another inclined plaine then collides with dominos. The dominoes then fall into a pulley which rises another ball into yet another inclined plaine then it rolls down into a needle which pops the balloon.
